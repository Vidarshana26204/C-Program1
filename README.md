# Simple Interactive C Program

This program takes formatted input from a textfile and stores it in an array of structs("line"). User has given options to
    1. View the contents of the array
    2. Sort the array - Using two sorting algorithms(sort.c)
        1. Bubble Sort
        2. Insertion Sort
        Output of the after sorting is written to a textfile.
    3. Search for a string within elements of the array. Implemented using Liner search and Binary search algorithms(search.c)
    4. Convert array to a Linked List(q1struct.c)
    5. Exit program
